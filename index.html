        <!-- About Us Section -->
        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
          Steak-In-It was established in late 2023 by Armando, Jackie and Devin.
          The family owned and operated company is Fairfield County’s very own
          Cheesesteak food truck and home to the “OG” Cheesesteak! With a
          combined 10+ years of experience in the food truck industry, we strive
          to provide you with the best quality food and service we can. Our
          journey wasn’t an easy one. Taking everything we have learned in the
          food truck industry over the years we wanted to do it the right way.
          Months of research went into our menu, our truck and our vision. We
          expect nothing but excellence from us and we go above and beyond to
          make sure your experience with us is one you won’t forget. Our truck
          usually will operate six days a week (Northeast weather pending) at a
          variety of places in Fairfield County, once in a while venturing out
          further into Connecticut. We are also available for your parties,
          events and special occasions. One of the most common questions we are
          asked is when do you open and close. Being that we are a food truck
          our hours change very often. Checking in on our social media or here
          on the website will be the best way for you to find out as we update
          it daily. Come and find us at one of our locations, order a
          cheesesteak and don’t be afraid to chat with us, here you are not just
          a number. Come hungry!
