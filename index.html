          <img src="img/logo2.jpg" alt="home banner image" />
          <p>
            Steak-In-It was established in late 2023 by Armando, Jackie and
            Devin. The family owned and operated company is Fairfield County’s
            very own Cheesesteak food truck and home to the “OG” Cheesesteak!
            With a combined 10+ years of experience in the food truck industry,
            we strive to provide you with the best quality food and service we
            can. Our journey wasn’t an easy one. Taking everything we have
            learned in the food truck industry over the years we wanted to do it
            the right way. Months of research went into our menu, our truck and
            our vision. We expect nothing but excellence from us and we go above
            and beyond to make sure your experience with us is one you won’t
            forget. Our truck usually will operate six days a week (Northeast
            weather pending) at a variety of places in Fairfield County, once in
            a while venturing out further into Connecticut. We are also
            available for your parties, events and special occasions. One of the
            most common questions we are asked is when do you open and close.
            Being that we are a food truck our hours change very often. Checking
            in on our social media or here on the website will be the best way
            for you to find out as we update it daily. Come and find us at one
            of our locations, order a cheesesteak and don’t be afraid to chat
            with us, here you are not just a number. Come hungry!
